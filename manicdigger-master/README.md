Code
----
OpenGL client is written in common subset of C# and [Ć programming lanuguage](http://cito.sourceforge.net/). It can be transcompiled to Java, C#, JavaScript, ActionScript, Perl and D. The only external dependency is [GamePlatform interface](ManicDiggerLib/Client/Platform.ci.cs).

Server is written in C#, but is going to be mostly ported to Ć.

Server mods are in C# or interpreted Javascript.
